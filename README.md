Welcome to the Smart Attendance System repository! This project showcases a machine learning-based attendance system that leverages face recognition technology using OpenCV. The system is designed to identify present students through a webcam and announce their names aloud using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine.

Features
Face Recognition: Utilizes OpenCV for detecting and recognizing faces in real-time.
Webcam Integration: Captures video input from a webcam to identify students.
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Pronounces the names of recognized students aloud.
Attendance Logging: Keeps a record of students who are present.
